Clone the RC3 repository\r\n2. cd ns-3.16\r\n3. ./waf configure -d release  \r\n4. ./waf\r\n5. ./run-baseline #runs the simulation with regular TCP, followed by RC3. It takes around 2 hours for each simulation to complete\r\n6. cd baseline-result\r\n7. ./getres-fair  #computes the average FCTs and stores them in improvements/ \r\n8. cd improvements\r\n9. ./getimp       #computes the % reduction and prints the results\r\n10. ./getplot-report #plots the baseline graph\r\n\r\nPlease contact us at (radhika @ eecs dot berkeley dot edu) or (justine @ eecs dot berkeley dot edu)\r\n- if you would like to test RC3 under more scenarios as done in the paper. We can send you the workloads and topologies we used, along with further instructions.\r\n- if you happen to find a bug! We have extensively tested RC3 and hope it is bug-free. But if there is a corner-case that we failed to take into account, please bring it to our notice.\r\n- if you have any other questions\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
